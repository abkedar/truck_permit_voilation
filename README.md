# USA Oversize & Overweight Truck Analysis
**This project presents an analytical study of **Oversize and Overweight Truck enforcement activities** across the United States using a real-world dataset. It covers annual data reported by states, including vehicle weight checks, violations, and permit issuances.**

## üì¶ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following information by **State** and **Year**:

- Number of vehicles weighed by scale type:
  - Fixed Platform
  - Weigh-In-Motion (WIM)
  - Portable
  - Semi-portable
- Oversize and Overweight violation counts
- Number of permits issued:
  - Divisible vs Non-divisible
  - Trip vs Annual
# Using Excel Sheet
## üìà Tools Used For Dashboard in Excel
- Microsoft Excel 2010

- Pivot Tables

- Charts and KPI Cards

- Dashboard Design

## üí° Key Insights (You can expand this later)

- Trends in scale usage across states
- Yearly changes in violations and permits
- State-wise compliance performance

# Using Python & Jupyter notebook
- Analyze trends in enforcement activity over time
- Identify which scale types are gaining or losing popularity
- Compare violations across states and over years
- Measure permit issuance patterns
- Calculate **compliance rates** and year-over-year changes
- Visualize all key findings in both **Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn)** and **Excel 2010**
